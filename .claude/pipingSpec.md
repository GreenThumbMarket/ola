# Dev Ticket: Update OLA CLI to Support Piping Output via Unix Utilities

## Objective:
The goal is to enhance the OLA CLI tool by enabling its output to be piped into other Unix utilities (e.g., `grep`, `sed`, `awk`) for further processing. This will provide users with more flexibility in automating workflows and integrating OLA CLI outputs into their existing tools.

## Key Features:
1. **Output Formatting**: Ensure that the output is in a format compatible with standard Unix utilities. This may involve modifying the CLI to produce plain text or machine-readable formats by default when piping is detected.
2. **Flag for Plain Text Mode**: Introduce a new flag (e.g., `--plain-text`) that users can enable to ensure the output is stripped of any non-essential formatting (like colors, emojis, etc.) and is suitable for piped input.
3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing to verify compatibility with common Unix utilities and edge cases.

## Dependencies:
- The CLI should already be using standard output (stdout) and error output (stderr) correctly.
- Familiarity with Unix shell scripting and pipeline operations.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. Users can pipe the output of `ola` commands into other utilities without issues (e.g., `ola ls | grep 'example'`).
2. The new flag (`--plain-text`) should work as intended, providing clean text output for piped commands.
3. No breaking changes should occur to existing workflows that rely on colored or formatted output.

## Next Steps:
- **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure compatibility with Unix utilities.
- **Documentation**: Update the OLA CLI documentation to include details about the new `--plain-text` flag and how to use it for piping.
